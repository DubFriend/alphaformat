# Alphaformat

Customizable code formatting of Javascript codebases.

For example, automatically sort all the keys of Javascript objects

## High Level Ideas

- Provide a high level set of common configurable code formattings
- Tooling to allow format entire files/folders (automatic), or just for a selected code snippet (manual)

  - Useful for formats that are highly context specific.
